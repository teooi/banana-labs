# Research

Game of life

Our research utilizes a unique cellular automata model inspired by Conway's Game of Life. We introduce an "environment" where individual organisms, represented by cellular automata patterns, evolve and interact. These organisms possess a genetic code, analogous to weights in neural networks, that determines their response to the surrounding environment. By recording and analyzing these genetic codes after multiple generations, we aim to uncover emergent patterns and strategies that lead to survival and success within the simulated ecosystem. This approach offers a bridge between artificial and biological systems, potentially shedding light on the evolution of complex behaviors. By understanding how simple rules and genetic variations can lead to diverse outcomes in the model, we may gain valuable insights into the intricate interplay between genetics, environment, and behavior, potentially informing future research in neuroscience and the functioning of the human brain.





Murmur

Repo: https://github.com/MaxwellFung/MurmurWebsite

murmurmatch.com

Murmur is the dating app that ditches swiping for something more intriguing. Instead of a superficial photo parade, you confidentially enter the usernames of your crushes. If your crush secretly adds you to their list too, then the magic happens! Murmur anonymously notifies you both, igniting a flame of possibility. No more wondering if your barista or cute classmate feels the same way â€“ Murmur lets you discreetly explore potential connections without the pressure of immediate rejection.





BlitzGo

In our ongoing research, we're developing a fast-paced variant of the ancient strategy game Go, called Blitzgo. Inspired by the "blitzkrieg" tactic of rapid conquest, Blitzgo prioritizes swift territorial dominance. This project delves into the intersection of artificial intelligence and human decision-making. We're currently building an AI model within the game that can learn and adapt its strategies to challenge human players.
