### About the our Research Lab

Our research lab investigates the complex workings of the human brain through a multi-pronged approach. We utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to capture brain activity patterns during various cognitive tasks. This data is then analyzed using deep learning algorithms, allowing us to identify neural networks associated with specific functions. To complement these large-scale studies, we delve into intriguing side projects. One such project involves simulating the simple yet captivating "Game of Life" cellular automata model. By analyzing the emergent patterns within the simulation, we aim to draw inferences that might illuminate fundamental principles of information processing within the brain. This combined approach – encompassing advanced neuroimaging, deep learning, and creative simulations – grants us a unique perspective to unlock the mysteries of the human mind.
